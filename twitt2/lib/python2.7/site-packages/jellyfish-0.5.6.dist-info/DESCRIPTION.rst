Example Usage
=============

>>> import jellyfish
>>> jellyfish.levenshtein_distance(u'jellyfish', u'smellyfish')
2
>>> jellyfish.jaro_distance(u'jellyfish', u'smellyfish')
0.89629629629629637
>>> jellyfish.damerau_levenshtein_distance(u'jellyfish', u'jellyfihs')
1

>>> jellyfish.metaphone(u'Jellyfish')
'JLFX'
>>> jellyfish.soundex(u'Jellyfish')
'J412'
>>> jellyfish.nysiis(u'Jellyfish')
'JALYF'
>>> jellyfish.match_rating_codex(u'Jellyfish')
'JLLFSH'
